                This space is a place for you to reflect. It’s important to have time to think about how you are 
                feeling and the good parts about your day, alongside the harder parts. <br/> This is what reflecting 
                means. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the top of this page there is a button to press called ‘Reflections’. <br/> If you click on this, 
                the page will move to another page which has a list of questions for you to answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you answer the questions, you can click the ‘Submit’ button and this will save your answers.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you scroll the page, you will then see all of the Reflections you have already saved, look 
                and see what’s been changing for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next to the saved Reflections, there is a ‘Delete’ button if you don’t want to save that Reflection 
                anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also some other information on the page. You can see how many Reflections you have 
                saved and what is your most frequent feeling.
